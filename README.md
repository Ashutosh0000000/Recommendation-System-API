Recommendation System API

FastAPI backend with async Redis caching and JWT authentication for scalable, personalized product recommendations.

🔥 50% DB load reduction via smart Redis caching with cache invalidation

🔒 Secured JWT auth for user registration, login, and protected endpoints

📊 Track users activity and serve real-time stats + personalized recommendations

🚀 Fully async, high-performance API with autogenerated Swagger docs

   Can be scaled up easily adding most frequent and recommended products with cache refreshing every  2-3 minutes

⚙️ Easy local setup with SQLite, migrations, and seed data

🧰 Tech Stack

Python 3.11 | FastAPI | PostgreSQL (async SQLAlchemy) | Redis (async caching) | JWT Auth | dotenv

⚙️ Key Features

JWT-based secure authentication(register, login, auth by pasting token)

Activity tracking via /api/activity/(create activity)

User stats and recommendations via /api/stats/(includes all stats with date, day and time and user id)

Async Redis caching embedded with TTL & dirty flag for efficient invalidation

Swagger UI docs at /docs for quick testing

🧊 Redis Cache Impact

Cache hits reduce DB queries by 50%+

Monitor key Redis metrics: keyspace_hits, keyspace_misses, used_memory_human

Use RedisInsight or CLI (redis-cli info stats) for live stats and monitoring

💰 Cost Efficiency with Redis Caching

Offloading frequent reads to Redis cache reduces database load by over 50%, lowering server CPU and I/O usage.

This translates to significant infrastructure cost savings by reducing the need to scale expensive database resources.

Smart cache invalidation (dirty flag) ensures fresh data without costly cache rebuild, maximizing resource efficiency.
